notes: |
  These are generic sample test cases for demonstration purposes only.
  
  To adapt for your use case:
  1. Replace inputs with queries relevant to your domain
  2. Update expected behaviors based on your system's purpose
  3. Adjust success thresholds based on your risk tier
  4. Add domain-specific test cases covering your critical scenarios
  5. Include edge cases specific to your application
  
  Remember:
  - Critical risk use cases need 100+ test cases per category
  - High risk use cases need 50+ test cases per category
  - Medium risk use cases need 20+ test cases per category
  - Low risk use cases need 10+ representative cases
